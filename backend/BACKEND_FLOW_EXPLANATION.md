## 🎯 **What is this Backend?**

This is the **backend** (server-side) of an e-commerce website. Think of it as the "brain" that:
- Stores all product information
- Manages user accounts
- Handles shopping cart
- Processes payments
- Sends emails
- Keeps track of orders

**Frontend** = What users see (website interface)
**Backend** = What works behind the scenes (this code)

---

## 🏗️ **Main Components Overview**

Our backend has 6 main parts (called "apps" in Django):

### 1. **Users App** 👥
- **What it does**: Manages all user accounts
- **Types of users**: Customers, Vendors, Managers, Admins
- **Key features**: Registration, login, email verification, password reset

### 2. **Products App** 🛍️
- **What it does**: Manages all products in the store
- **Key features**: Product catalog, categories, variants (colors/sizes), images

### 3. **Cart App** 🛒
- **What it does**: Manages shopping cart
- **Key features**: Add/remove items, update quantities, calculate totals

### 4. **Orders App** 📦
- **What it does**: Handles order processing
- **Key features**: Checkout, payment processing, order tracking

### 5. **Wishlist App** ❤️
- **What it does**: Lets users save favorite products
- **Key features**: Add/remove from wishlist, bulk operations

### 6. **Core App** ⚙️
- **What it does**: Shared utilities and base classes
- **Key features**: Common serializers, shared functionality

## 🔄 **User Flow Step by Step**

### **Step 1: User Registration** 📝
```
User visits website → Clicks "Sign Up" → Fills form → 
Backend creates account → Sends verification email → 
User clicks email link → Account activated
```

**What happens in backend:**
1. User fills registration form
2. Backend validates data (email unique, password strong)
3. Creates user account (but inactive)
4. Generates verification token
5. Sends email with verification link
6. User clicks link → Account becomes active

### **Step 2: User Login** 🔐
```
User enters email/password → Backend checks credentials → 
If valid: Returns JWT token → User can access protected features
```

**What happens in backend:**
1. User sends email/password
2. Backend checks if credentials are correct
3. If correct: Creates JWT token (like a temporary ID card)
4. Token allows user to access protected features

### **Step 3: Browse Products** 🛍️
```
User visits product page → Backend sends product list → 
User can filter by category, search, sort by price
```

**What happens in backend:**
1. Frontend requests product list
2. Backend queries database for active products
3. Applies filters (category, search, sorting)
4. Returns product data with images, prices, stock

### **Step 4: Add to Cart** 🛒
```
User clicks "Add to Cart" → Backend checks stock → 
If available: Adds to cart → Updates cart total
```

**What happens in backend:**
1. User selects product and quantity
2. Backend checks if product is in stock
3. If available: Adds to user's cart
4. If already in cart: Updates quantity
5. Calculates new cart total

### **Step 5: Checkout Process** 💳
```
User clicks "Checkout" → Backend validates cart → 
Creates order → Processes payment → Sends confirmation
```

**What happens in backend:**
1. Validates cart has items
2. Checks stock availability again
3. Creates order record
4. Integrates with Stripe for payment
5. If payment succeeds: Updates order status
6. Reduces product stock
7. Clears user's cart
8. Sends order confirmation email

## 🏛️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Framework: Django REST Framework**
- **Django**: Python web framework (like a toolkit for building websites)
- **REST Framework**: Makes it easy to create APIs (ways for frontend to talk to backend)

### **Database: PostgreSQL**
- Stores all data (users, products, orders, etc.)
- Reliable and handles many users at once

### **Authentication: JWT Tokens**
- JWT = JSON Web Token
- Like a temporary ID card that proves who you are
- Expires after some time for security

### **Payment: Stripe Integration**
- Stripe handles credit card processing
- We send payment info to Stripe
- Stripe tells us if payment succeeded or failed

### **Email: Celery + Email Service**
- Celery = Background task processor
- Sends emails without slowing down the website
- Uses SendGrid or similar service

## 🔧 **Key Features Explained**

### **1. User Management System**
```
Different user types with different permissions:
- Customer: Can buy products
- Vendor: Can sell products (needs approval)
- Manager: Can manage vendors
- Admin: Can do everything
```

### **2. Product Management**
```
Products have:
- Basic info (name, description, price)
- Variants (different colors)
- Sizes for each variant
- Images for each variant
- Stock tracking
```

### **3. Shopping Cart**
```
Cart features:
- Add/remove products
- Update quantities
- Check stock availability
- Calculate totals
- Persists between sessions
```

### **4. Order Processing**
```
Order flow:
1. Create order from cart
2. Validate everything
3. Process payment
4. Update stock
5. Send confirmation
6. Track order status
```

### **5. Email System**
```
Email types:
- Account verification
- Password reset
- Order confirmation
- Welcome messages
- Role-specific notifications
```
